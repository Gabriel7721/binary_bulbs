# binary_bulbs
Program to Teach Binary Numbers Using Bulbs
Concept:
Each bulb represents a binary digit (bit).
A bulb being "on" represents the bit value 1.
A bulb being "off" represents the bit value 0.
A sequence of bulbs can represent any binary number.
Steps:
Explain Binary System: Introduce the binary numbering system and how it differs from the decimal system.
Bulb Representation: Show how each bulb represents a bit.
Binary to Decimal Conversion: Teach students how to convert binary numbers (represented by bulbs) to decimal numbers.
Practice Examples: Use interactive examples where students turn bulbs on/off to create binary numbers.
