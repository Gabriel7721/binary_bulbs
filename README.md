# Binary Bulbs

**Program to Teach Binary Numbers Using Bulbs**

## Concept

- Each bulb represents a binary digit (bit).
- A bulb being "on" represents the bit value 1.
- A bulb being "off" represents the bit value 0.
- A sequence of bulbs can represent any binary number.

## Steps

1. **Explain Binary System**
   - Introduce the binary numbering system and how it differs from the decimal system.
   
2. **Bulb Representation**
   - Show how each bulb represents a bit.

3. **Binary to Decimal Conversion**
   - Teach students how to convert binary numbers (represented by bulbs) to decimal numbers.

4. **Practice Examples**
   - Use interactive examples where students turn bulbs on/off to create binary numbers.

## Usage

- Interactive learning tool for understanding binary numbers.
- Ideal for teaching students the basics of binary arithmetic and conversion to/from decimal.

## Features

- Toggle bulbs to represent binary digits.
- Convert binary sequences to decimal values in real-time.
- Adjustable bit count for various levels of difficulty.
